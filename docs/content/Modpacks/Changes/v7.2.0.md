# Updating from `7.1.4` to `7.2.0`


## Models
If you have any block model that 
 - has overridden base textures when part of a formed structure (fluid hatch coloring for say an EBF), 
 - doesn't use any of the builtin model methods that set it,

in the MachineDefinition, you need to add `.modelProperty(GTMachineModelProperties.IS_FORMED, false)`

## Ranged inputs/outputs
In recipes, you can now use:
- `.itemInputsRanged(..., min, max)`
- `.itemOutputssRanged(..., min, max)`
- `.fluidInputsRanged(..., min, max)`
- `.fluidOutputsRanged(..., min, max)`

Where the inputs or outputs will be rolled inclusively from min to max.

## Rock breaker conditions
Previously, rock breaker recipes used the `addData("fluidA", ...)` methods.

Now, they work by AdjacentFluidConditions, added with the `adjacentFluid(Fluid...)` methods. See [our other condition builder methods](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern/blob/1.20.1/src/main/java/com/gregtechceu/gtceu/integration/kjs/recipe/GTRecipeSchema.java#L894).

In a similar vein, recipes that used to have adjacent block requirements, you now need to use `adjacentBlock(Block...)` rather than `addData("blockA")`.

## Recipe Conditions
We have moved away from the .serialize, .deserialize, .toNetwork and .fromNetwork calls on the RecipeCondition, and we now exclusively use the codecs registered in GTRecipeConditions.
